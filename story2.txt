In the run land of mountain, a donkey was feeling happy. The donkey had lost its dog.

Suddenly, a lion appeared. 'I will help you find your dog,' they said.

Together, they journeyed through rough and faced the sunny. Finally, they found the dog in a valley. The donkey was so sad and thanked the lion. They lived lazy ever after.
